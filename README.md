# peer.js

A project using PeerJS that wraps the browser's WebRTC implementation to create a peer-to-peer connection API.

A peer can create a P2P data or media stream connection to a remote peer.

I plan to connect a database to this project to and send media blobs to be stored to the database from the client front-end.
